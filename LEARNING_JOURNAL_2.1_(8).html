          <strong>Name:</strong> Ivan Cortes<br />
          <strong>Course:</strong> CareerFoundry – Python for Web Developers<br />
          <strong>Exercise:</strong> 2.1 – Getting Started with Django<br />
          <strong>Date:</strong> October 2025
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>What This Exercise Was About</h2>
        <p>
          Exercise 2.1 was my introduction to Django. After spending Achievement 1 learning Python basics and building a command-line Recipe App, this exercise was about understanding what Django is before actually using it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exercise had two parts: research questions about Django (theory) and setting up my computer with Django installed (practice). No coding yet—just learning what Django does and why developers use it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>The Research Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>Question 1: Why Django is Popular</h3>
        <p>
          I researched why so many developers choose Django for web development. The main reasons are that Django comes with lots of features already built-in (like user accounts and security), it's used by huge companies like Instagram and Pinterest, and it helps you build websites faster than starting from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Full answer is in my submitted PDF document.</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Question 2: Companies Using Django</h3>
        <p>
          I found five major companies that use Django and learned what they use it for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Instagram</strong> – Uses Django for everything (user accounts, photo feeds, the whole backend)</li>
          <li><strong>Pinterest</strong> – Manages all the pins and boards with Django</li>
          <li><strong>Spotify</strong> – Uses Django for internal tools and managing artists/playlists</li>
          <li><strong>Mozilla</strong> – Runs their Firefox add-ons store with Django</li>
          <li><strong>NASA</strong> – Uses Django for websites and project management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>Detailed explanations are in my submitted PDF document.</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Question 3: When to Use Django</h3>
        <p>
          I evaluated five different project scenarios to decide if Django was the right tool:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple users?</strong> YES – Django has user accounts built-in</li>
          <li><strong>Fast development?</strong> YES – Django helps you build things quickly</li>
          <li><strong>Very simple app?</strong> NO – Django is too complex for basic stuff</li>
          <li><strong>Want total control?</strong> MAYBE NOT – Django does things "its way"</li>
          <li><strong>Big project needing support?</strong> YES – Django has great documentation and community</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>Full reasoning for each scenario is in my submitted PDF document.</em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>What I Learned from the Research</h2>
        
        <h3>Django is a Framework</h3>
        <p>
          A framework is like a pre-built house structure. Instead of building every wall from scratch, you get the basic structure and just add your custom features. Django provides the structure for web applications.
        </p>

        <h3>MVT Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Django uses something called MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture. This is just a fancy way of saying it separates your code into three parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Model</strong> – How data is stored (like recipes in a database)</li>
          <li><strong>View</strong> – The logic (what happens when someone clicks a button)</li>
          <li><strong>Template</strong> – What users see (the HTML pages)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Keeping these separate makes code easier to change later.
        </p>

        <h3>When NOT to Use Django</h3>
        <p>
          The most important thing I learned: Django isn't always the answer. For really simple programs that don't need a database or user accounts, Django is overkill. It's like using a semi-truck to go to the grocery store.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>The Technical Setup</h2>
        
        <h3>What I Did</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Checked Python is installed (I have version 3.13.5)</li>
          <li>Created a new virtual environment called "achievement2-practice"</li>
          <li>Installed Django 5.x (course uses 3.2.4, but newer is better)</li>
          <li>Took 3 screenshots showing everything works</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Virtual Environment</h3>
        <p>
          A virtual environment is like a separate workspace for Django. It keeps Django's files separate from other Python projects so they don't interfere with each other. Think of it like having a separate toolbox just for Django work.
        </p>

        <h3>Version Differences</h3>
        <p>
          The course shows Django 3.2.4 from 2021. I installed Django 5.x (current version from 2024). Using the newer version is actually better because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It has the latest security fixes</li>
          <li>Better error messages that help me learn</li>
          <li>Skills I learn apply to current job market</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I documented this difference in my screenshots to show I understand the versions don't match the course material.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Challenges I Had</h2>

        <h3>Understanding the Terminology</h3>
        <p>
          Django uses confusing names. What Django calls a "View" is actually the logic part (other frameworks call this the "Controller"). What Django calls a "Template" is what others call a "View." Once I stopped worrying about the names and focused on what each part DOES, it made more sense.
        </p>

        <h3>Virtual Environment Commands</h3>
        <p>
          The course shows commands for "virtualenvwrapper" which doesn't work in Git Bash. I used the built-in "venv" instead, which works fine but has different commands. This is a common situation in programming—finding alternative tools when the suggested one doesn't work on your system.
        </p>

        <h3>Knowing When Django is Overkill</h3>
        <p>
          It was tempting to think "Django is great, so use it for everything!" But Question 3 taught me to think critically. Sometimes simpler tools are better. This reminds me of the saying: "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

        <div class="simple-box">
          <strong>What I Now Understand:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Django is a web framework that comes with lots of features built-in</li>
            <li>It's used by major companies at massive scale</li>
            <li>Not every project needs Django—sometimes simpler is better</li>
            <li>MVT architecture keeps code organized into data/logic/presentation</li>
            <li>Virtual environments keep project dependencies separate</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="simple-box">
          <strong>What I Can Do Now:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Explain why Django is popular</li>
            <li>Evaluate whether a project needs Django or not</li>
            <li>Set up a Django development environment</li>
            <li>Install Django in a virtual environment</li>
            <li>Verify installations with terminal commands</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Connection to Achievement 1</h2>
        <p>
          Everything I learned in Achievement 1 still applies—Django is still Python! The Recipe App I built in the command line will become a web application using Django. Same data (recipes with names, ingredients, cooking time), same logic (calculate difficulty, search recipes), but now with a web interface instead of command-line text.
        </p>
        <p>
          The OOP concepts from Exercise 1.5 will help me understand Django models. The database work from Exercise 1.6 is similar to what Django's ORM does automatically. Nothing was wasted—it all builds on what came before.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <p>
          Exercise 2.1 was all theory and setup. Exercise 2.2 will be hands-on: actually creating a Django project, understanding the file structure, and making the first web page. I'll use the <code>django-admin</code> command to create the project structure and start the development server.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I understand WHY Django exists and WHEN to use it, learning HOW to use it should make more sense. The theoretical foundation from this exercise will help me understand why Django organizes projects the way it does.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>AI Assistance Note</h2>
        <p>
          This exercise required adapting course materials from 2021 (Python 3.8.7, Django 3.2.4) to current versions (Python 3.13.5, Django 5.x). AI assistance helped me:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand version differences between course materials and current software</li>
          <li>Find authoritative sources for company Django usage research</li>
          <li>Clarify confusing MVT vs MVC terminology</li>
          <li>Troubleshoot virtual environment setup in Git Bash</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All research, answers, installations, and screenshots were completed independently. AI served as a guide for navigating version differences and understanding concepts, similar to consulting documentation or asking a mentor for clarification.
